# Optimizing Last-Mile Delivery Costs Through Geo-Spatial Analysis of Delivery Routes

## Overview

This project analyzes last-mile delivery routes to identify and recommend optimizations that aim to reduce delivery costs by 15% within the next quarter.  The analysis leverages geo-spatial data to pinpoint inefficiencies in current routes and proposes alternative, cost-effective solutions. This is achieved through the application of various data analysis techniques and visualization methods.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* [Add other libraries used here, e.g., Geopandas, Scikit-learn]


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will perform the geo-spatial analysis and generate the output described below.


## Example Output

The script will produce the following output:

* **Console Output:**  Printed summaries of key findings, including identified inefficiencies in existing routes and estimated cost savings from proposed optimizations.  Specific metrics such as total distance reduction and estimated cost reduction will be presented.

* **Plot Files:**  Visualization of current and optimized routes will be saved as image files (e.g., `current_routes.png`, `optimized_routes.png`). These plots will visually demonstrate the impact of the recommended changes.  [Add other plot descriptions if applicable].
